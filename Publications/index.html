                    As one of the most abundant monoterpenes in the atmosphere,-pinene ozonolysis is a critical pathway in the atmospheric chemistry of biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs), significantly influencing air quality and climate modeling. Its oxidation products contribute substantially to aerosol mass, especially in forested areas. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of -pinene secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation via ozone oxidation, using the Washington Aerosol Module combined with the Framework for 0-D Atmospheric Modeling (F0AM-WAM) to simulate gas-phase reactions and subsequent SOA formation, under both preexisting chamber experiments and field measurements (Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study, SOAS). This study evaluates how different chemical mechanisms—namely, the master chemistry mechanism (MCMv331), the peroxy radical autoxidation mechanism (PRAM), and our newly-developed UCR mechanism—affect the prediction of SOA yields and compositions. Our findings show that MCMv331 substantially underestimates SOA formation, while PRAM leads to excessive dimer formation, constituting up to 90% in some chamber experiments. The UCR mechanism integrates peroxy radical autoxidation and dimer formation processes, enhancing the prediction of less-volatile product yields in line with experimental measurements. Moreover, we explore the effects of autoxidation rates, alkoxy radical fates and C* estimation on aerosol formations and found that these factors can bring great uncertainty to the SOA prediction. Specifically, a decrease in autoxidation rates to one-tenth of current values, which are based on existing literature, can lead to an approximately 40% reduction in SOA formation. Employing two C* estimation methods, SIMPOL and EPI, we found that that SIMPOL method can provide relatively consistent results, whereas the EPI method significantly overestimates the vapor pressure of monoterpene-related species, leading to an underestimation of SOA formation to about one-tenth of the measured values. Sensitivity analysis involving C* adjustment by a factor of 2 indicated that changes in SOA predictions can vary by 30%, underscoring the substantial uncertainty associated with C* estimations in SOA modeling.

                        Isoprene has the largest global non-methane hydrocarbon emission, and the oxidation of isoprene plays 
                        a crucial role in the formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOA). Two primary processes are known 
                        to contribute to SOA formation from isoprene oxidation: (1) the reactive uptake of isoprene-derived 
                        epoxides on acidic or aqueous particle surfaces and (2) the absorptive gas-particle partitioning of 
                        low-volatility oxidation products. In this study, we developed a new multiphase condensed isoprene 
                        oxidation mechanism that include these processes with key molecular intermediates and products. The
new mechanism was applied to simulate isoprene gas-phase oxidation products and SOA formation from previously published
chamber experiments under a variety of conditions and atmospheric observations during the Southern Oxidant and Aerosol
20 Studies (SOAS) field campaign. Our results show that SOA formation from most of the chamber experiments is reasonably
reproduced using our mechanism except when the concentration ratios of initial nitric oxide to isoprene exceeds ~2. The SOAS
simulations also reasonably agree with the measurements regarding the diurnal pattern and concentrations of different product
categories. The molecular compositions of the modelled SOA indicate that multifunctional low-volatility products contribute
to isoprene SOA more significantly than previously thought, with a median mass contribution of ~57% to the total modelled
25 isoprene SOA. This contribution, however, may vary greatly, mainly dependent on the volatility estimation and treatment of
particle-phase processes (i.e., photolysis and hydrolysis). Our findings emphasize that the various pathways to produce these
low-volatility species should be considered in models to more accurately predict isoprene SOA formation. The new condensed
isoprene chemical mechanism can be further incorporated into regional-scale air quality models, such as the Community
Multiscale Air Quality Modelling System (CMAQ), to assess isoprene SOA formation on a larger scale.

                    Multiphase oxidative aging is a ubiquitous process for atmospheric organic aerosols (OA). But its kinetics was often found to be slow in previous laboratory studies where high hydroxyl radical concentrations ([•OH]) were used. In this study, we performed heterogeneous oxidation experiments of several model OA systems under varied aging timescales and gas-phase [•OH]. Our results suggest that OA heterogeneous oxidation may be 2–3 orders of magnitude faster when [•OH] is decreased from typical laboratory flow tube conditions to atmospheric levels. Direct laboratory mass spectrometry measurements coupled with kinetic simulations suggest that an intermolecular autoxidation mechanism mediated by particle-phase peroxy radicals greatly accelerates OA oxidation, with enhanced formation of organic hydroperoxides, alcohols, and fragmentation products. With autoxidation, we estimate that the OA oxidation timescale in the atmosphere may be from less than a day to several days. Thus, OA oxidative aging can have greater atmospheric impacts than previously expected. Furthermore, our findings reveal the nature of heterogeneous aerosol oxidation chemistry in the atmosphere and help improve the understanding and prediction of atmospheric OA aging and composition evolution.                    </p>

Inorganic species always coexist with organic materials in atmospheric particles and may influence the heterogeneous oxidation of organic aerosols. However, very limited studies have explored the role of the inorganics in the chemical evolution of organic species in mixed aerosols. This study examines the heterogeneous oxidation of glutaric acid–ammonium sulfate and 1,2,6-hexanetriol–ammonium sulfate aerosols by hydroxyl radicals (OH) under varied organic mass fractions (forg) and relative humidity in a flow tube reactor. Coupling the oxidation kinetics and product measurements with kinetic model simulations, we found that under both low relative humidity (RH, 30–35%) and high RH conditions (85%), the decreased forg from 0.7 to 0.2 accelerates the oxidation of the organic materials by a factor of up to 11. We suggest that the faster oxidation kinetics under low-RH conditions is due to full or partial phase separation, with the organics greatly enriched at the particle outer region, while enhanced “salting-out” of the organics and OH adsorption caused by higher inorganics could explain the observations under high-RH conditions. Analysis of the oxidation products reveals that the dilution of organics by the inorganic salts and corresponding water uptake under high-RH conditions will favor alkoxy radical fragmentation by a factor of 3–4 and inhibit its secondary chain propagation chemistry. Our results suggest that atmospheric organic aerosol oxidation lifetime and composition are strongly impacted by the coexistent inorganic salts.

Submicron particles larger than 300 nm dominate the aerosol light extinction and mass concentration in the atmosphere. The water uptake ability of this size range greatly influences the particle mass, visibility degradation, and particle chemistry. However, most previous field measurements on aerosol hygroscopicity are limited within 350 nm. In this study, the size-resolved aerosol hygroscopic properties over an extended size range (50–600 nm) at 85 % relative humidity were investigated in Beijing winter from 27 November 2019 to 14 January 2020 using a humidity tandem differential mobility analyzer (HTDMA) instrument. The corresponding aerosol optical properties were also analyzed using the Mie scattering theory. Results show that the averaged probability distribution of growth factor (GF-PDF) is generally constituted by a more hygroscopic (MH) group and a less hygroscopic (LH) group (including hydrophobic). For the particles larger than 300 nm, there exists a large fraction of LH group particles, resulting in an unexpected low hygroscopicity. During the development of pollution, when particles are gradually aged and accumulated, the bulk hygroscopicity above 300 nm is enhanced significantly by the growth and expansion of the MH group. This result is supported by previous chemical composition analysis, and we give more direct and detailed evidence from the growth factor and mixing-state aspects. Our calculations indicate that the optical contribution of particles larger than 300 nm constitutes about two-thirds of the total aerosol extinction. The large hygroscopic variation in aerosols above 300 nm will influence the light degradation comparably with the increase in aerosol loading in low-visibility haze events. Our studies highlight that the hygroscopic properties above 300 nm are complex and vary greatly with different pollution stages. Therefore more field measurements and investigations need to be done in the future.</p>

The humidified tandem differential mobility analyzer (HTDMA) is widely used to measure the hygroscopic properties of submicron particles. The size-resolved aerosol hygroscopicity κ measured by a HTDMA will be influenced by the contribution of multiply charged aerosols, but this effect on field measurements has seldom been discussed for previous field measurements. Our calculations demonstrate that the number ratio of multiply charged particles is quite considerable for some specific sizes between 100 and 300 nm, especially during a pollution episode. The presence of multiple charges will lead to a compression effect on the aerosol hygroscopicity in HTDMA measurements. Therefore, we propose a new algorithm that performs multi-charge correction of the size-resolved hygroscopicity κ, taking both the compression effect and the multi-charge number contribution into consideration. Application of the algorithm to field measurements showed that the relatively high hygroscopicity in the accumulation size range leads to the overestimation of the hygroscopicity of particles smaller than 200 nm. The low hygroscopicity of coarse-mode particles leads to the underestimation of the hygroscopicity of accumulation particles between 200 and 500 nm in size. The difference between the corrected and measured κ values can be as large as 0.05, highlighting that special attention must be paid to the multi-charge effect when a HTDMA is used for aerosol hygroscopicity measurements.

    The core diameter and shell thickness of black carbon (BC)-containing ambient aerosols directly determine their corresponding optical properties and aging processing, influencing significantly on the environment and climate change. The information of ambient particle core-shell structure is usually obtained using the single particle soot photometer (SP2) measurements. In this study, we found that the particle sizes measured by SP2 were limited within the core diameter larger than 84 nm and particle scattering diameter larger than 178 nm. There were about 34.9% of the ambient BC-containing aerosols that are mistaken for pure BC aerosols without coating. The lower limits of SP2 measurement lead to overestimation of the pure BC aerosol number concentrations and missing information of the shell thickness of BC-containing aerosol. Thus the statistical shell thickness of ambient BC-containing particles was underestimated and the aging process of ambient BC-containing aerosols derived from the SP2 measurements is misleading.

            The aerosol–planetary boundary layer (PBL) interaction was proposed as an important mechanism to stabilize the atmosphere 
                and exacerbate surface air pollution. Despite the tremendous progress made in understanding this process, its magnitude 
                and significance still have large uncertainties and vary largely with aerosol distribution and meteorological conditions. 
                In this study, we focus on the role of aerosol vertical distribution in thermodynamic stability and PBL development by 
                jointly using micropulse lidar, sun photometer, and radiosonde measurements taken in Beijing. Despite the complexity of 
                aerosol vertical distributions, cloud-free aerosol structures can be largely classified into three types: well-mixed, 
                decreasing with height, and inverse structures. The aerosol–PBL relationship and diurnal cycles of the PBL height and PM2.5 
                associated with these different aerosol vertical structures show distinct characteristics. The vertical distribution of 
                aerosol radiative forcing differs drastically among the three types, with strong heating in the lower, middle, and upper 
                PBL, respectively. Such a discrepancy in the heating rate affects the atmospheric buoyancy and stability differently in 
                the three distinct aerosol structures. Absorbing aerosols have a weaker effect of stabilizing the lower atmosphere under 
                the decreasing structure than under the inverse structure. As a result, the aerosol–PBL interaction can be strengthened 
                by the inverse aerosol structure and can be potentially neutralized by the decreasing structure. Moreover, aerosols can 
                both enhance and suppress PBL stability, leading to both positive and negative feedback loops. This study attempts to 
                improve our understanding of the aerosol–PBL interaction, showing the importance of the observational constraint of aerosol 
                vertical distribution for simulating this interaction and consequent feedbacks.

Emissions of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) from sea spray can impact climate and precipitation by changing cloud formation, 
    precipitation, and albedo. However, the relationship between seawater biogeochemistry and the ice nucleation activity of 
    sea spray aerosols remains unclarified. Here, we demonstrate a link between the biological productivity in seawater and 
    the ice nucleation activity of sea spray aerosol under conditions relevant to cirrus and mixed-phase cloud formation. We 
    show for the first time that aerosol particles generated from both subsurface and microlayer seawater from the highly 
    productive eastern tropical North Pacific Ocean are effective INPs in the deposition and immersion freezing modes. Seawater 
    particles of composition similar to subsurface waters of highly productive regions may therefore be an unrealized source of 
    effective INPs. In contrast, the subsurface water from the less productive Florida Straits produced less effective immersion 
    mode INPs and ineffective depositional mode INPs. These results indicate that the regional biogeochemistry of seawater can 
    strongly affect the ice nucleation activity of sea spray aerosol.

 For the past two decades, quantitative retrievals of aerosol optical depth (AOD) have been made from both geostationary and polar-orbiting satellites, and the results have been widely used in numerous studies. Despite the progress made in improving the accuracy of AOD retrievals, there are still major challenges, especially over land. A notable one for the so-called Dark-Target (DT) algorithms is building the surface reflectance (SR) relationships (SRR) to derive SR in the visible channels from SR in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) channel, mainly because these relationships are strongly subjected to entangled factors (e.g., viewing geometry, surface type, and vegetation state). In this study, we examine the benefits of a new method for deriving the SRR using deep learning techniques. The SRR constructed by the deep neural network (DNN) considers multiple related inputs, such as the SWIR normalized difference vegetation index (NDVISWIR), viewing geometry, and seasonality, among others. We then incorporate the DNN-constrained SRR into a DT algorithm developed at NOAA/STAR to retrieve AOD from the Advanced Himawari Instrument (AHI) onboard the new generation of geostationary satellites, Himawari-8. The revised DT algorithm with the deep learning technique (DTDL) demonstrates improved performance over the study region (95–125°E, 18–30°N, a portion of the AHI full disk), as attested by significantly reduced random noise, especially for low NDVISWIR and high surface albedo cases. Robust independent tests indicate that this algorithm can be applied to untrained regions, not only to those used in training. The method directly benefits the algorithm development for Himawari-8 and can also be adopted for other geostationary or polar-orbiting satellites. Our study illustrates how artificial intelligence could significantly improve AOD retrievals from multi-spectral satellite observations following this new approach.

The mechanisms and seasonal differences of the impact of aerosols on daytime surface urban heat island

<p>
The urban heat island intensity (UHII) is the temperature difference between urban areas and their rural surroundings. It is commonly attributed to changes in the underlying surface structure caused by urbanization. Air pollution caused by aerosol particles can affect the UHII through changing (1) the surface energy balance by the aerosol radiative effect (ARE) and (2) planetary-boundary-layer (PBL) stability and airflow intensity by modifying thermodynamic structure, which is referred to as the aerosol dynamic effect (ADE). By analyzing satellite data and ground-based observations collected from 2001 to 2010 at 35 cities in China and using the WRF-Chem model, we find that the impact of aerosols on UHII differs considerably: reducing the UHII in summer but increasing the UHII in winter. This seasonal contrast is proposed to be caused by the different strengths of the ARE and ADE between summer and winter. In summer, the ARE on UHII is dominant over the ADE, cooling down surface temperature more strongly in urban areas than in rural areas because of much higher aerosol loading, and offsets the urban heating, therefore weakening UHII. In winter, however, the ADE is more dominant, because aerosols stabilize the PBL more in the polluted condition, weakening the near-surface heat transport over urban areas in both vertical and horizontal directions. This means that the heat accumulated in urban areas is dispersed less effectively, and thus the UHII is enhanced. These findings shed new light on the impact of the interaction between urbanization-induced surface changes and air pollution on urban climate.

<p>
The local-scale precipitation (LSP) is mainly driven by thermal convection. Here we reveal a decreasing trend in the summertime 
    LSP frequency over both China and the United States by utilizing the hourly rain gauge data from 1981 to 2012. The contrasting 
    aerosol trend likely contributes to this same declining trend of LSP in both countries. As aerosol optical depth (AOD) goes 
    beyond the turning zone of 0.25–0.30, the impact of aerosol on precipitation changes from invigoration to suppression. The mean 
    AOD is generally less and larger than this range and of opposite trends in China and United States, respectively, which likely 
    accounts for the same declining trend of LSP hours in the two countries. The observed boomerang shape points to the importance 
    of aerosol loading, which matters as much as, if not more than the AOD trend, thereby potentially serving as a constraint for 
    climate model evaluation.

 Water vapor supersaturation, as one of the most important environmental parameters during the formation of clouds or fogs, 
    cannot be directly measured, and few studies have been carried out to estimate it in the ambient activation process. 
    In this study, a new method to estimate the water vapor supersaturation based on the inverse application of κ-Köhler 
    theory is proposed. Aerosol hygroscopic parameter κ, dry particle size distributions, and wet droplet size distributions 
    were employed and a comparison of predicted droplet number concentration with the measurement results was made to obtain 
    the effective supersaturation during the activation process. Using this method, we acquired the supersaturations varying 
    from 0.01% to 0.05% in a fog episode observed in the North China Plain. In this fog episode, both hydrated unactivated 
    droplets and activated droplets play a part in the total detected droplet number concentrations with the unactivated 
    droplets' ratio decreasing with size. The sensitivity study was also made to evaluate the effects of droplet and aerosol 
    hygroscopic measurement errors on the supersaturation ratio estimation. Water vapor supersaturation obtained with this 
    method can be regarded as an effective value and can be further applied to cloud analysis in the future. This method is 
    only based on conventional measurements of aerosol and droplets and does not rely on any other data, which makes it flexible 
    and easy to perform. Calculated supersaturations and critical diameters can also deepen the understanding of ambient activation 
    process and corresponding interactions between aerosol and droplet characteristics.

<p>
The planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) is a very important parameter in the atmosphere, because it determines the range where the most effective dispersion processes take place, and serves as a constraint on the vertical transport of heat, moisture, and pollutants. As the only space-borne lidar, Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization onboard Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) measures the vertical distribution of aerosol signals and thus offers the potential to retrieve large-scale PBLH climatology. In this study, we explore different techniques for retrieving PBLH from CALIPSO measurements and validate the results against those obtained from ground-based micropulse lidar (MPL) and radiosonde (RS) data over Hong Kong, where long-term MPL and RS measurements are available. Two methods, namely maximum standard deviation (MSD) and wavelet covariance transform (WCT), are used to retrieve PBLH from CALIPSO. Results show that the RS- and MPL-derived PBLHs share similar interannual variation and seasonality and can complement each other. Both MSD and WCT perform reasonably well compared with MPL/RS products, especially under sufficient aerosol loading. Uncertainties increase when aerosol loading is low and the CALIPSO signal consequently becomes noisier. Overall, CALIPSO captures the general PBLH seasonal variability over Hong Kong, despite a high bias in spring and a low bias in summer. The spring high bias is likely associated with elevated aerosol layers due to transport, while the summer low bias can be attributed to higher noise level associated with weaker aerosol signal.

 Summer precipitation plays critical roles in the energy balance and the availability of fresh water over eastern China. However, little is known regarding the trend in local-scale precipitation (LSP). Here we developed a novel method to determine LSP events in the summer afternoon throughout eastern China from 1970 to 2010 based on hourly gauge measurements. The LSP occurrence hours decrease at an annual rate of 0.25%, which varies considerably by region, ranging from 0.14% over the Yangtze River Delta to 0.56% over the Pearl River Delta. This declining frequency of LSP is generally accompanied by an increase in rain rate of LSP but a decrease in visibility, whose linkage to LSP events was investigated. In particular, more LSP events tended to form when the atmosphere was slightly polluted. Afterward, LSP was suppressed. These findings have important implications for improving our understanding of the climatology of daytime precipitation at local scales.

<p>
Due to the limited spatial coverage of surface PM2.5 monitoring sites, satellite AOD (aerosol optical depth) products have been widely used to estimate surface PM2.5 in different parts of the world. A major difficulty as well as source of uncertainty in converting AOD to PM2.5 is the determination of aerosol vertical distribution, usually represented by the boundary layer height (BLH). In this study, we evaluate the performance of different approaches of estimating aerosol vertical distributions in the AOD-PM2.5 conversion process, using long-term and multi-source data acquired at a super station, Yuen Long, Hong Kong. The monthly climatology of aerosol vertical distribution and BLH products derived from lidar, radiosonde, and MERRA reanalysis data are respectively applied for converting AOD to surface aerosol extinction coefficients. Seasonal empirical hygroscopic growth functions are constructed to convert aerosol extinction to dry PM2.5 mass concentration. Results indicate that different vertical distribution estimation approaches can have highly varying effect on the converted PM2.5 concentration. Using lidar-derived BLHs shows the best agreement, with a correlation coefficient of 0.73 and a relative bias of 30.6% between retrievals and observations. Since continuous lidar measurements are not available for most regions, the climatology pattern of aerosol structure and radiosonde-derived BLHs are found to be suitable alternatives with a correlation coefficient of ∼0.6, and considerably outperform the results using BLHs derived from reanalysis data. Elevated aerosol layers appear to be the major source of uncertainty and result in an overestimate of satellite results, especially during the spring and summer seasons.

<p>
Raman lidar is an effective technique to retrieve the vertical distribution of atmospheric water vapor. For the first time, we present water vapor profiles retrieved by a high dynamic Raman lidar system over the Beijing area for representative cases in spring 2014, within the framework of the Aerosol Multi-wavelength Polarization Lidar Experiment project. In springtime, water vapor content over Beijing is generally low but with a strong daily variability. Its evolution is strongly coupled with winds and aerosols, with clouds also exerting a distinct impact. Northwesterly winds is found to be the most important factor impacting the temporal variability of water vapor mixing ratio (WVMR), and WVMR is found to be negatively correlated with wind speed. Moreover, we find that clouds tend to cause significant increases in the standard deviation of WMVR measurement, and relative humidity sharply increase below the cloud base. During a typical pollution episode, water vapor strongly covaries with aerosols due to hygroscopic growth effect and transport mechanism. Both water vapor and aerosols exhibit the highest variability within the planetary boundary layer (PBL), where the development and dissipation of haze mainly occur. Within the PBL, water vapor and aerosol concentration demonstrate different evolution features at different altitudes during the haze process, with a delayed increase and early decrease for higher altitudes. Back trajectory analysis using the hybrid single-particle Lagrangian trajectory model indicates that this phenomenon is most likely associated with different sources of the air mass at different altitudes.

<p>
Pollution in China has been attracting extensive attention both globally and regionally, especially due to the perceptually worsening “smog” condition in recent years. We use routine visibility measurements from 1980 to 2013 at 272 World Meteorological Organization stations in China to assess the temporal changes in the magnitude and the sign of pollution trends. A strict and comprehensive quality control procedure is enforced by considering several issues not typically addressed in previous studies. Two methods are used to independently estimate the trend and its significance level. Results show that, in general, a strong increase in aerosol extinction coefficient over the majority of China is observed in the 1980s, followed by a moderate decrease in the 1990s, another increase in the 2000s, and a shift to decrease since around 2006 for some regions. Seasonally, winter and fall trends appear to be the strongest, while summer has the lowest trend.
