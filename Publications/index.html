                    <p>Isoprene has the largest global non-methane hydrocarbon emission, and the oxidation of isoprene plays 
                        a crucial role in the formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOA). Two primary processes are known 
                        to contribute to SOA formation from isoprene oxidation: (1) the reactive uptake of isoprene-derived 
                        epoxides on acidic or aqueous particle surfaces and (2) the absorptive gas-particle partitioning of 
                        low-volatility oxidation products. In this study, we developed a new multiphase condensed isoprene 
                        oxidation mechanism that include these processes with key molecular intermediates and products. The
new mechanism was applied to simulate isoprene gas-phase oxidation products and SOA formation from previously published
chamber experiments under a variety of conditions and atmospheric observations during the Southern Oxidant and Aerosol
20 Studies (SOAS) field campaign. Our results show that SOA formation from most of the chamber experiments is reasonably
reproduced using our mechanism except when the concentration ratios of initial nitric oxide to isoprene exceeds ~2. The SOAS
simulations also reasonably agree with the measurements regarding the diurnal pattern and concentrations of different product
categories. The molecular compositions of the modelled SOA indicate that multifunctional low-volatility products contribute
to isoprene SOA more significantly than previously thought, with a median mass contribution of ~57% to the total modelled
25 isoprene SOA. This contribution, however, may vary greatly, mainly dependent on the volatility estimation and treatment of
particle-phase processes (i.e., photolysis and hydrolysis). Our findings emphasize that the various pathways to produce these
low-volatility species should be considered in models to more accurately predict isoprene SOA formation. The new condensed
isoprene chemical mechanism can be further incorporated into regional-scale air quality models, such as the Community
Multiscale Air Quality Modelling System (CMAQ), to assess isoprene SOA formation on a larger scale.

                    Multiphase oxidative aging is a ubiquitous process for atmospheric organic aerosols (OA). But its kinetics was often found to be slow in previous laboratory studies where high hydroxyl radical concentrations ([•OH]) were used. In this study, we performed heterogeneous oxidation experiments of several model OA systems under varied aging timescales and gas-phase [•OH]. Our results suggest that OA heterogeneous oxidation may be 2–3 orders of magnitude faster when [•OH] is decreased from typical laboratory flow tube conditions to atmospheric levels. Direct laboratory mass spectrometry measurements coupled with kinetic simulations suggest that an intermolecular autoxidation mechanism mediated by particle-phase peroxy radicals greatly accelerates OA oxidation, with enhanced formation of organic hydroperoxides, alcohols, and fragmentation products. With autoxidation, we estimate that the OA oxidation timescale in the atmosphere may be from less than a day to several days. Thus, OA oxidative aging can have greater atmospheric impacts than previously expected. Furthermore, our findings reveal the nature of heterogeneous aerosol oxidation chemistry in the atmosphere and help improve the understanding and prediction of atmospheric OA aging and composition evolution.                    </p>

Inorganic species always coexist with organic materials in atmospheric particles and may influence the heterogeneous oxidation of organic aerosols. However, very limited studies have explored the role of the inorganics in the chemical evolution of organic species in mixed aerosols. This study examines the heterogeneous oxidation of glutaric acid–ammonium sulfate and 1,2,6-hexanetriol–ammonium sulfate aerosols by hydroxyl radicals (OH) under varied organic mass fractions (forg) and relative humidity in a flow tube reactor. Coupling the oxidation kinetics and product measurements with kinetic model simulations, we found that under both low relative humidity (RH, 30–35%) and high RH conditions (85%), the decreased forg from 0.7 to 0.2 accelerates the oxidation of the organic materials by a factor of up to 11. We suggest that the faster oxidation kinetics under low-RH conditions is due to full or partial phase separation, with the organics greatly enriched at the particle outer region, while enhanced “salting-out” of the organics and OH adsorption caused by higher inorganics could explain the observations under high-RH conditions. Analysis of the oxidation products reveals that the dilution of organics by the inorganic salts and corresponding water uptake under high-RH conditions will favor alkoxy radical fragmentation by a factor of 3–4 and inhibit its secondary chain propagation chemistry. Our results suggest that atmospheric organic aerosol oxidation lifetime and composition are strongly impacted by the coexistent inorganic salts.

Submicron particles larger than 300 nm dominate the aerosol light extinction and mass concentration in the atmosphere. The water uptake ability of this size range greatly influences the particle mass, visibility degradation, and particle chemistry. However, most previous field measurements on aerosol hygroscopicity are limited within 350 nm. In this study, the size-resolved aerosol hygroscopic properties over an extended size range (50–600 nm) at 85 % relative humidity were investigated in Beijing winter from 27 November 2019 to 14 January 2020 using a humidity tandem differential mobility analyzer (HTDMA) instrument. The corresponding aerosol optical properties were also analyzed using the Mie scattering theory. Results show that the averaged probability distribution of growth factor (GF-PDF) is generally constituted by a more hygroscopic (MH) group and a less hygroscopic (LH) group (including hydrophobic). For the particles larger than 300 nm, there exists a large fraction of LH group particles, resulting in an unexpected low hygroscopicity. During the development of pollution, when particles are gradually aged and accumulated, the bulk hygroscopicity above 300 nm is enhanced significantly by the growth and expansion of the MH group. This result is supported by previous chemical composition analysis, and we give more direct and detailed evidence from the growth factor and mixing-state aspects. Our calculations indicate that the optical contribution of particles larger than 300 nm constitutes about two-thirds of the total aerosol extinction. The large hygroscopic variation in aerosols above 300 nm will influence the light degradation comparably with the increase in aerosol loading in low-visibility haze events. Our studies highlight that the hygroscopic properties above 300 nm are complex and vary greatly with different pollution stages. Therefore more field measurements and investigations need to be done in the future.</p>

Effects of multi-charge on aerosol hygroscopicity measurement by a HTDMA

The humidified tandem differential mobility analyzer (HTDMA) is widely used to measure the hygroscopic properties of submicron particles. The size-resolved aerosol hygroscopicity κ measured by a HTDMA will be influenced by the contribution of multiply charged aerosols, but this effect on field measurements has seldom been discussed for previous field measurements. Our calculations demonstrate that the number ratio of multiply charged particles is quite considerable for some specific sizes between 100 and 300 nm, especially during a pollution episode. The presence of multiple charges will lead to a compression effect on the aerosol hygroscopicity in HTDMA measurements. Therefore, we propose a new algorithm that performs multi-charge correction of the size-resolved hygroscopicity κ, taking both the compression effect and the multi-charge number contribution into consideration. Application of the algorithm to field measurements showed that the relatively high hygroscopicity in the accumulation size range leads to the overestimation of the hygroscopicity of particles smaller than 200 nm. The low hygroscopicity of coarse-mode particles leads to the underestimation of the hygroscopicity of accumulation particles between 200 and 500 nm in size. The difference between the corrected and measured κ values can be as large as 0.05, highlighting that special attention must be paid to the multi-charge effect when a HTDMA is used for aerosol hygroscopicity measurements.

Respirable particles with aerodynamic diameters ≤ 10 µm (PM10) have important impacts on the atmospheric environment and human health. Available PM10 datasets have coarse spatial resolutions, limiting their applications, especially at the city level. A tree-based ensemble learning model, which accounts for spatiotemporal information (i.e., space-time extremely randomized trees, denoted as the STET model), is designed to estimate near-surface PM10 concentrations. The 1-km resolution Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) aerosol product and auxiliary factors, including meteorology, land-use cover, surface elevation, population distribution, and pollutant emissions, are used in the STET model to generate the high-resolution (1 km) and high-quality PM10 dataset for China (i.e., ChinaHighPM10) from 2015 to 2019. The product has an out-of-sample (out-of-station) cross-validation coefficient of determination (CV-R2) of 0.86 (0.82) and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 24.28 (27.07) μg/m3, outperforming most widely used models from previous related studies. High levels of PM10 concentration occurred in northwest China (e.g., the Tarim Basin) and the Northern China Plain. Overall, PM10 concentrations had a significant declining trend of 5.81 μg/m3 per year (p < 0.001) over the past five years in China, especially in three key urban agglomerations. The ChinaHighPM10 dataset is potentially useful for future small- and medium-scale air pollution studies by virtue of its higher spatial resolution and overall accuracy.

Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) can significantly harm human health and increase the risk of death. Satellite remote sensing allows for generating spatially continuous PM2.5 data, but current datasets have overall low accuracies with coarse spatial resolutions limited by data sources and models. Air pollution levels in China have experienced dramatic changes over the past couple of decades. However, country-wide ground-based PM2.5 records only date back to 2013. To reveal the spatiotemporal variations of PM2.5, long-term and high-spatial-resolution aerosol optical depths, generated by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Multi-Angle implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm, were employed to estimate PM2.5 concentrations at a 1 km resolution using our proposed Space-Time Extra-Trees (STET) model. Our model can capture well variations in PM2.5 concentrations at different spatiotemporal scales, with higher accuracies (i.e., cross-validation coefficient of determination, CV-R2 = 0.86–0.90) and stronger predictive powers (i.e., R2 = 0.80–0.82) than previously reported. The resulting PM2.5 dataset for China (i.e., ChinaHighPM2.5) provides the longest record (i.e., 2000 to 2018) at a high spatial resolution of 1 km, enabling the study of PM2.5 variation patterns at different scales. In most places, PM2.5 concentrations showed increasing trends around 2007 and remained high until 2013, after which they declined substantially, thanks to a series of government actions combating air pollution in China.

 The planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) is an important parameter for understanding the accumulation of pollutants and the dynamics of the lower atmosphere. Lidar has been used for tracking the evolution of PBLH by using aerosol backscatter as a tracer, assuming aerosol is generally well-mixed in the PBL; however, the validity of this assumption actually varies with atmospheric stability. This is demonstrated here for stable boundary layers (SBL), neutral boundary layers (NBL), and convective boundary layers (CBL) using an 8-year dataset of micropulse lidar (MPL) and radiosonde (RS) measurements at the ARM Southern Great Plains, and MPL at the GSFC site. Due to weak thermal convection and complex aerosol stratification, traditional gradient and wavelet methods can have difficulty capturing the diurnal PBLH variations in the morning and forenoon, as well as under stable conditions generally. A new method is developed that combines lidar-measured aerosol backscatter with a stability dependent model of PBLH temporal variation (DTDS). The latter helps “recalibrate” the PBLH in the presence of a residual aerosol layer that does not change in harmony with PBL diurnal variation. The hybrid method offers significantly improved PBLH detection, with better correlation and smaller biases, under most thermodynamic conditions, especially for SBL and CBL. Relying on the physical process of PBL diurnal development, different schemes are developed for growing, maintenance, and decaying periods. Comprehensive evaluation of this new method shows much better tracking of diurnal PBLH variation and significantly smaller biases under various pollution levels.

<p>
The aerosol–planetary boundary layer (PBL) interaction was proposed as an important mechanism to stabilize the atmosphere and exacerbate surface air pollution. Despite the tremendous progress made in understanding this process, its magnitude and significance still have large uncertainties and vary largely with aerosol distribution and meteorological conditions. In this study, we focus on the role of aerosol vertical distribution in thermodynamic stability and PBL development by jointly using micropulse lidar, sun photometer, and radiosonde measurements taken in Beijing. Despite the complexity of aerosol vertical distributions, cloud-free aerosol structures can be largely classified into three types: well-mixed, decreasing with height, and inverse structures. The aerosol–PBL relationship and diurnal cycles of the PBL height and PM2.5 associated with these different aerosol vertical structures show distinct characteristics. The vertical distribution of aerosol radiative forcing differs drastically among the three types, with strong heating in the lower, middle, and upper PBL, respectively. Such a discrepancy in the heating rate affects the atmospheric buoyancy and stability differently in the three distinct aerosol structures. Absorbing aerosols have a weaker effect of stabilizing the lower atmosphere under the decreasing structure than under the inverse structure. As a result, the aerosol–PBL interaction can be strengthened by the inverse aerosol structure and can be potentially neutralized by the decreasing structure. Moreover, aerosols can both enhance and suppress PBL stability, leading to both positive and negative feedback loops. This study attempts to improve our understanding of the aerosol–PBL interaction, showing the importance of the observational constraint of aerosol vertical distribution for simulating this interaction and consequent feedbacks.

After the 2020 Lunar New Year, the Chinese government implemented a strict nationwide lockdown to inhibit the spread of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Despite the abrupt decreases in gaseous emissions caused by record-low anthropogenic activities, severe haze pollution occurred in northern China during the COVID lockdown. This paradox has attracted the attention of both the public and the scientific community. By analyzing comprehensive measurements of air pollutants, planetary boundary layer (PBL) height, and surface meteorology, we show that the severe air pollution episode over northern China coincided with the abnormally low PBL height, which had reduced by 45%, triggering strong aerosol-PBL interactions. After dynamical processes initiated the temperature inversion, the Beijing metropolitan area experienced a period with continuously shallow PBLs during the lockdown. This unprecedented event provided an experiment showcasing the role of meteorology, in particular aerosol-PBL interactions in affecting air quality.

 For the past two decades, quantitative retrievals of aerosol optical depth (AOD) have been made from both geostationary and polar-orbiting satellites, and the results have been widely used in numerous studies. Despite the progress made in improving the accuracy of AOD retrievals, there are still major challenges, especially over land. A notable one for the so-called Dark-Target (DT) algorithms is building the surface reflectance (SR) relationships (SRR) to derive SR in the visible channels from SR in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) channel, mainly because these relationships are strongly subjected to entangled factors (e.g., viewing geometry, surface type, and vegetation state). In this study, we examine the benefits of a new method for deriving the SRR using deep learning techniques. The SRR constructed by the deep neural network (DNN) considers multiple related inputs, such as the SWIR normalized difference vegetation index (NDVISWIR), viewing geometry, and seasonality, among others. We then incorporate the DNN-constrained SRR into a DT algorithm developed at NOAA/STAR to retrieve AOD from the Advanced Himawari Instrument (AHI) onboard the new generation of geostationary satellites, Himawari-8. The revised DT algorithm with the deep learning technique (DTDL) demonstrates improved performance over the study region (95–125°E, 18–30°N, a portion of the AHI full disk), as attested by significantly reduced random noise, especially for low NDVISWIR and high surface albedo cases. Robust independent tests indicate that this algorithm can be applied to untrained regions, not only to those used in training. The method directly benefits the algorithm development for Himawari-8 and can also be adopted for other geostationary or polar-orbiting satellites. Our study illustrates how artificial intelligence could significantly improve AOD retrievals from multi-spectral satellite observations following this new approach.

The climatology of lower tropospheric temperature inversions in China from radiosonde measurements: roles of black carbon, local meteorology, and large-scale subsidence     </a>

<p>
The variability of the lower tropospheric temperature inversion (TI) across China remains poorly understood. Using seven years’ worth of high-resolution radiosonde measurements at 120 sites, we compile the climatology of lower tropospheric TI in terms of frequency, intensity, and depth during the period from 2011 to 2017. The TI generally exhibits strong seasonal and geographic dependencies. Particularly, the TI frequency is found to be high in winter and low in summer, likely due to the strong aerosol radiative effect in winter. The frequency of the surface-based inversion (SBI) exhibits a “west low, east high” pattern at 0800 Beijing time (BJT), which then switches to “west high, east low” at 2000 BJT. Both the summertime SBI and elevated inversion (EI) reach a peak at 0800 BJT and a trough at 1400 BJT. Interestingly, the maximum wintertime EI frequency occurs over Southeast China (SEC) rather than over the North China Plain (NCP), likely attributable to the combination of the heating effect of black carbon (BC) originating from the NCP, along with the strong subsidence and trade inversion in SEC. Correlation analyses between local meteorology and TI indicate that larger lower tropospheric stability (LTS) favors more frequent and stronger TIs, whereas the stronger EI under smaller LTS conditions (unstable atmosphere) is more associated with subsidence rather than BC. Overall, the spatial pattern of the lower tropospheric TI and its variability in China are mainly controlled by three factors: local meteorology, large-scale subsidence, and BC-induced heating. These findings help shed some light on the magnitude, spatial distribution, and underlying mechanisms of the lower tropospheric TI variation in China.

The mechanisms and seasonal differences of the impact of aerosols on daytime surface urban heat island

<p>
The urban heat island intensity (UHII) is the temperature difference between urban areas and their rural surroundings. It is commonly attributed to changes in the underlying surface structure caused by urbanization. Air pollution caused by aerosol particles can affect the UHII through changing (1) the surface energy balance by the aerosol radiative effect (ARE) and (2) planetary-boundary-layer (PBL) stability and airflow intensity by modifying thermodynamic structure, which is referred to as the aerosol dynamic effect (ADE). By analyzing satellite data and ground-based observations collected from 2001 to 2010 at 35 cities in China and using the WRF-Chem model, we find that the impact of aerosols on UHII differs considerably: reducing the UHII in summer but increasing the UHII in winter. This seasonal contrast is proposed to be caused by the different strengths of the ARE and ADE between summer and winter. In summer, the ARE on UHII is dominant over the ADE, cooling down surface temperature more strongly in urban areas than in rural areas because of much higher aerosol loading, and offsets the urban heating, therefore weakening UHII. In winter, however, the ADE is more dominant, because aerosols stabilize the PBL more in the polluted condition, weakening the near-surface heat transport over urban areas in both vertical and horizontal directions. This means that the heat accumulated in urban areas is dispersed less effectively, and thus the UHII is enhanced. These findings shed new light on the impact of the interaction between urbanization-induced surface changes and air pollution on urban climate.

<p>
Urbanization and air pollution are major anthropogenic impacts on Earth’s environment, weather, and climate. Each has been studied extensively, but their interactions have not. Urbanization leads to a dramatic variation in the spatial distribution of air pollution (fine particles) by altering surface properties and boundary-layer micrometeorology, but it remains unclear, especially between the centers and suburbs of metropolitan regions. Here, we investigated the spatial variation, or inhomogeneity, of air quality in urban and rural areas of 35 major metropolitan regions across China using four different long-term observational datasets from both ground-based and space-borne observations during the period 2001–2015. In general, air pollution in summer in urban areas is more serious than in rural areas. However, it is more homogeneously polluted, and also more severely polluted in winter than that in summer. Four factors are found to play roles in the spatial inhomogeneity of air pollution between urban and rural areas and their seasonal differences: (1) the urban–rural difference in emissions in summer is slightly larger than in winter; (2) urban structures have a more obvious association with the spatial distribution of aerosols in summer; (3) the wind speed, topography, and different reductions in the planetary boundary layer height from clean to polluted conditions have different effects on the density of pollutants in different seasons; and (4) relative humidity can play an important role in affecting the spatial inhomogeneity of air pollution despite the large uncertainties.

The local-scale precipitation (LSP) is mainly driven by thermal convection. Here we reveal a decreasing trend in the summertime LSP frequency over both China and the United States by utilizing the hourly rain gauge data from 1981 to 2012. The contrasting aerosol trend likely contributes to this same declining trend of LSP in both countries. As aerosol optical depth (AOD) goes beyond the turning zone of 0.25–0.30, the impact of aerosol on precipitation changes from invigoration to suppression. The mean AOD is generally less and larger than this range and of opposite trends in China and United States, respectively, which likely accounts for the same declining trend of LSP hours in the two countries. The observed boomerang shape points to the importance of aerosol loading, which matters as much as, if not more than the AOD trend, thereby potentially serving as a constraint for climate model evaluation.

<p>
  The next-generation geostationary meteorological Himawari-8 satellite carrying the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) allows frequent observations of the atmosphere, the surface, and oceans every 10 min. With its retrieval algorithms recently updated, Himawari-8/AHI Version 2 Level 2 aerosol products are now available. However, these retrievals have not yet undergone a quality assessment. This study aims to comprehensively validate the official aerosol optical properties derived from Himawari-8/AHI over land and ocean. Aerosol Robotic Network and Sun-Sky Radiometer Observation Network ground-based measurements at 98 stations in the Himawari-domain region are used to validate aerosol optical depth (AOD, or τ) retrievals at 500 nm and Ångström exponent (AE) retrievals at 440–675 nm from the year 2016. The AOD retrievals agree well with surface observations (i.e., from linear regression, slope = 0.876, intercept = 0.076, and correlation coefficient = 0.756) with a mean absolute error and a root-mean-square error of 0.168 and 0.293, respectively. On site and regional scales, large uncertainties are seen, especially in Australia (significant overestimation) and South Asia (significant underestimation). The AOD retrievals can correctly capture daily variations and show the best (worst) performance in summer (spring). The AE performance is poorer on all scales, showing overall underestimations, especially in Australia, Southeast Asia, and China. The data quality of AOD retrievals improves as the vegetation coverage and the AE increases. This suggests that the official aerosol retrieval algorithm still faces great challenges over bright surfaces and under coarse-particle-dominated conditions. In general, approximately 61% and 64% of the AOD matchups meet the newly defined expected errors of [0.330 × τ + 0.024; −0.132 × τ − 0.125] and [0.519 × τ + 0.005; −0.007 × τ − 0.194] determined by ground measurements and aerosol retrievals, respectively. The highly variable accuracy of aerosol retrievals raises a concern about the reliability of the current product under different environmental conditions and underlying surfaces. It also sheds light on what future improvements need implementing to the aerosol retrieval algorithm.

<p>
The Planetary boundary layer (PBL) plays an important role in energy exchange and pollutant dispersion. The height of the PBL (PBLH) usually exhibits distinct diurnal variation. In this study, we investigate the characteristics of PBLH variation of Beijing China based on 1-year observations from Micropulse LIDAR (MPL) data, and compared against the PBLH simulated by the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model using eight different schemes. The variation of daytime MPL PBLH has been classified into four representative types using k-means clustering technique. Through comparison against MPL, it is shown that the Mellor-Yamada Nakanishi and Niino Level 3 (MYNN3) scheme, a second-order closure scheme, performs the best in representing the PBLH variation in most of the cases. The non-local schemes also show advantages in convective situations, due to the stronger vertical mixing embedded in these schemes. Further analyses show that differences in PBLH definition is a major factor causing the divergence among different schemes, while the biases of the profiles play a minor role.

<p>
The frequent occurrence of severe air pollution episodes in China has been a great concern and thus the focus of intensive studies. Planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) is a key factor in the vertical mixing and dilution of near-surface pollutants. However, the relationship between PBLH and surface pollutants, especially particulate matter (PM) concentration across China, is not yet well understood. We investigate this issue at ∼1600 surface stations using PBLH derived from space-borne and ground-based lidar, and discuss the influence of topography and meteorological variables on the PBLH–PM relationship. Albeit the PBLH–PM correlations are roughly negative for most cases, their magnitude, significance, and even sign vary considerably with location, season, and meteorological conditions. Weak or even uncorrelated PBLH–PM relationships are found over clean regions (e.g., Pearl River Delta), whereas nonlinearly negative responses of PM to PBLH evolution are found over polluted regions (e.g., North China Plain). Relatively strong PBLH–PM interactions are found when the PBLH is shallow and PM concentration is high, which typically corresponds to wintertime cases. Correlations are much weaker over the highlands than the plains regions, which may be associated with lighter pollution loading at higher elevations and contributions from mountain breezes. The influence of horizontal transport on surface PM is considered as well, manifested as a negative correlation between surface PM and wind speed over the whole nation. Strong wind with clean upwind air plays a dominant role in removing pollutants, and leads to obscure PBLH–PM relationships. A ventilation rate is used to jointly consider horizontal and vertical dispersion, which has the largest impact on surface pollutant accumulation over the North China Plain. As such, this study contributes to improved understanding of aerosol–planetary boundary layer (PBL) interactions and thus our ability to forecast surface air pollution.

<p>
The planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) is a very important parameter in the atmosphere, because it determines the range where the most effective dispersion processes take place, and serves as a constraint on the vertical transport of heat, moisture, and pollutants. As the only space-borne lidar, Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization onboard Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) measures the vertical distribution of aerosol signals and thus offers the potential to retrieve large-scale PBLH climatology. In this study, we explore different techniques for retrieving PBLH from CALIPSO measurements and validate the results against those obtained from ground-based micropulse lidar (MPL) and radiosonde (RS) data over Hong Kong, where long-term MPL and RS measurements are available. Two methods, namely maximum standard deviation (MSD) and wavelet covariance transform (WCT), are used to retrieve PBLH from CALIPSO. Results show that the RS- and MPL-derived PBLHs share similar interannual variation and seasonality and can complement each other. Both MSD and WCT perform reasonably well compared with MPL/RS products, especially under sufficient aerosol loading. Uncertainties increase when aerosol loading is low and the CALIPSO signal consequently becomes noisier. Overall, CALIPSO captures the general PBLH seasonal variability over Hong Kong, despite a high bias in spring and a low bias in summer. The spring high bias is likely associated with elevated aerosol layers due to transport, while the summer low bias can be attributed to higher noise level associated with weaker aerosol signal.

<p>
 Summer precipitation plays critical roles in the energy balance and the availability of fresh water over eastern China. However, little is known regarding the trend in local-scale precipitation (LSP). Here we developed a novel method to determine LSP events in the summer afternoon throughout eastern China from 1970 to 2010 based on hourly gauge measurements. The LSP occurrence hours decrease at an annual rate of 0.25%, which varies considerably by region, ranging from 0.14% over the Yangtze River Delta to 0.56% over the Pearl River Delta. This declining frequency of LSP is generally accompanied by an increase in rain rate of LSP but a decrease in visibility, whose linkage to LSP events was investigated. In particular, more LSP events tended to form when the atmosphere was slightly polluted. Afterward, LSP was suppressed. These findings have important implications for improving our understanding of the climatology of daytime precipitation at local scales.

<p>
Due to the limited spatial coverage of surface PM2.5 monitoring sites, satellite AOD (aerosol optical depth) products have been widely used to estimate surface PM2.5 in different parts of the world. A major difficulty as well as source of uncertainty in converting AOD to PM2.5 is the determination of aerosol vertical distribution, usually represented by the boundary layer height (BLH). In this study, we evaluate the performance of different approaches of estimating aerosol vertical distributions in the AOD-PM2.5 conversion process, using long-term and multi-source data acquired at a super station, Yuen Long, Hong Kong. The monthly climatology of aerosol vertical distribution and BLH products derived from lidar, radiosonde, and MERRA reanalysis data are respectively applied for converting AOD to surface aerosol extinction coefficients. Seasonal empirical hygroscopic growth functions are constructed to convert aerosol extinction to dry PM2.5 mass concentration. Results indicate that different vertical distribution estimation approaches can have highly varying effect on the converted PM2.5 concentration. Using lidar-derived BLHs shows the best agreement, with a correlation coefficient of 0.73 and a relative bias of 30.6% between retrievals and observations. Since continuous lidar measurements are not available for most regions, the climatology pattern of aerosol structure and radiosonde-derived BLHs are found to be suitable alternatives with a correlation coefficient of ∼0.6, and considerably outperform the results using BLHs derived from reanalysis data. Elevated aerosol layers appear to be the major source of uncertainty and result in an overestimate of satellite results, especially during the spring and summer seasons.

<p>
Raman lidar is an effective technique to retrieve the vertical distribution of atmospheric water vapor. For the first time, we present water vapor profiles retrieved by a high dynamic Raman lidar system over the Beijing area for representative cases in spring 2014, within the framework of the Aerosol Multi-wavelength Polarization Lidar Experiment project. In springtime, water vapor content over Beijing is generally low but with a strong daily variability. Its evolution is strongly coupled with winds and aerosols, with clouds also exerting a distinct impact. Northwesterly winds is found to be the most important factor impacting the temporal variability of water vapor mixing ratio (WVMR), and WVMR is found to be negatively correlated with wind speed. Moreover, we find that clouds tend to cause significant increases in the standard deviation of WMVR measurement, and relative humidity sharply increase below the cloud base. During a typical pollution episode, water vapor strongly covaries with aerosols due to hygroscopic growth effect and transport mechanism. Both water vapor and aerosols exhibit the highest variability within the planetary boundary layer (PBL), where the development and dissipation of haze mainly occur. Within the PBL, water vapor and aerosol concentration demonstrate different evolution features at different altitudes during the haze process, with a delayed increase and early decrease for higher altitudes. Back trajectory analysis using the hybrid single-particle Lagrangian trajectory model indicates that this phenomenon is most likely associated with different sources of the air mass at different altitudes.

<p>
Pollution in China has been attracting extensive attention both globally and regionally, especially due to the perceptually worsening “smog” condition in recent years. We use routine visibility measurements from 1980 to 2013 at 272 World Meteorological Organization stations in China to assess the temporal changes in the magnitude and the sign of pollution trends. A strict and comprehensive quality control procedure is enforced by considering several issues not typically addressed in previous studies. Two methods are used to independently estimate the trend and its significance level. Results show that, in general, a strong increase in aerosol extinction coefficient over the majority of China is observed in the 1980s, followed by a moderate decrease in the 1990s, another increase in the 2000s, and a shift to decrease since around 2006 for some regions. Seasonally, winter and fall trends appear to be the strongest, while summer has the lowest trend.
